                <h1>Streamlining GIS Processes for Cambium Inc.​</h1>
                <p id="tagline">Simplifying the air photo selection process by creating a web application and streamlining the extraction and delivery of well water data.​</p>
                <p>Our client, Cambium Inc., has requested two main solutions to a) modernize and update their internal Well Water Information System (WWIS) database and b) modify their aerial imagery database (including making the imagery internally accessible to those without enterprise software licensing). This proposal aims to clearly state the project objectives, proposed solution(s), methodologies, workflows, deliverables, and project timeline required to achieve the proposal’s stated objectives.</p>
                <p>We assess the client’s original project requirements and determine a set of solutions that will meet their core business needs, optimize their existing technologies and eliminate redundancy. Consideration given to ongoing maintenance and costs with the use of open-source software and pre-existing software licensing, as well as optimal storage and retrieval solutions for both well water data and aerial imagery (including REST endpoint server architecture and Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs).</p>
